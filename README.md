# The_Rough_Mile
GeoTracks scripts for interactive soundwalk: The Rough Mile. This walk is located in Nottingham city centre. 
This script set include geolocation information, audio track information, and 'scene' information to be used in conjunction with the daoplayer (CGreenhalgh github).
There are three layers of audio used in this experience: narration, music and ambient tracks of the environment. Each scene introduces a change of state to one or more layers of audio. For instance a scene may introduce a new musical element while keeping the same narration and ambient audio playing from the preceding scene.
